DataMiner
=========

This program is for secret usage...

* To make the miner work, the python package, scrapy has to be installed first.
* To run the miner, just go into the directory of the scrapy(e.g. touchline), and use command: scrapy crawel touchline, which will produce a data.csv file

* The current version will request to manually change the range of game IDs in spider/touchine_spyder.py. Further version will be able to configure this using seperate configuration file or console input.
